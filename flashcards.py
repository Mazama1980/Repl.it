[x] Part 1: Make a csv file
[x] Part 2: Start flashcards.py
[x] Part 3: start load_csv()
[x] Part 4: Read each line of the csv file
[x] Part 5: Get the card data from the csv file
[x] Part 6: Return the card data to main()
[x] Part 7: Remove extra whitespace
[x] Part 8: Skip the header row
[ ] Part 9: Start the play() functionÂ¶

    This function should take one argument, the list of cards. Eventually it
    will contain the user interface for running through each card, getting the
    answers from the user, and printing the score.

    For now we'll just write a play() function and call it.

    play()
    [x] write a play() function that takes one argument: cards
    [x] for temporary debugging, print something from it

    main()
    [x] call play() passing it the list of cards
