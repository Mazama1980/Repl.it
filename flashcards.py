Flashcards
# https://alissa-huskey.github.io/python-class/exercises/flashcards.html; https://alissa-huskey.github.io/python-class/lessons/functions.html#table-of-contents

[x] Part 1: Make a csv file
[x] Part 2: Start flashcards.py
[x] Part 3: start load_csv()
[x] Part 4: Read each line of the csv file
[x] Part 5: Get the card data from the csv file
[x] Part 6: Return the card data to main()
[x] Part 7: Remove extra whitespace
[x] Part 8: Skip the header row
[x] Part 9: Start the play() function
[x] Part 10: Go through each card in random order
[x] Part 11: Test the user
[x] Part 12: Scorekeeping
[x] Part 13: Prettify flashcards
[x] Part 14: Wrap long questionsÂ¶
[x] Part 15: Add topics menu
[x] Part 16: Allow answers with commas

[ ] Bonus: (from funcitons param live share)
    [x] If you don't already have one, make a global variable DEBUG
    [x] Write a function named: debug with one parameter: message
    [x] In the function, check if DEBUG is True (or truthy)
        [x] If so, then print message
        [x] Bonus: Print someting before it like "DEBUG: ", or "# ", so you can more
            easily tell that it is a debug message
    [x] Throughout your code, anywhere where you are printing something that is not
        directly related to the flashcards program (ie. "loading {path}..."), call
        your new debug function instead of printing it.
    [x] Also look for any comment out print statements, change print to debug, and uncomment them.
    [ ] Perhaps add a few extra debug messages. For example, you might want to print
        the function name at the beginning of each function.
    [ ] Test with DEBUG set to True as well as with DEBUG set to False
    
!!!Choices input of 0 (zero) is not loading all the cards. Need to fix!!!
