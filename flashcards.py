[x] Part 1: Make a csv file
[x] Part 2: Start flashcards.py
[x] Part 3: start load_csv()
[x] Part 4: Read each line of the csv file
[x] Part 5: Get the card data from the csv file
[x] Part 6: Return the card data to main()
[x] Part 7: Remove extra whitespace
[x] Part 8: Skip the header row
[x] Part 9: Start the play() function
[x] Part 10: Go through each card in random order
[x] Part 11: Test the user
[x] Part 12: Scorekeeping
[x] Part 13: Prettify flashcards
[x] Part 14: Wrap long questionsÂ¶
[ ] Part 15: Add topics menu
    
    at the top of your file

      [x] Make a list assigned to the global variable TOPICS

    menu()

      [ ] write a menu() function

      [ ] assign TOPICS to a list of Path objects in your flashcards directory
          using the .iterdir() method

      [ ] print an error message if no files are found in your flashcards
          directory

      [ ] print the filename minus the .csv extension for each Path object in
          the TOPICS list, next to a number

      [ ] print a special option "all" with a menu selection of 0

      [ ] make a list assigned to the variable selection

      [ ] get input from the user asking them to choose one or more topics and
          assign it to a variable choices

      [ ] use the .split() method to split choices into multiple items on
          whitespace

      [ ] iterate over each response and assign to num:

          [ ] if the response is "0", return TOPICS

          [ ] convert num to an int and subtract 1

          [ ] get the item from TOPICS at the num index and append it to
              selection list

          [ ] return the selection list

    in main()

        [ ] at the beginning of the function, make an empty cards list

        [ ] call menu() and assign the returned value to the variable paths

        [ ] remove the line where you previously defined the path to your .csv
            file

        [ ] iterate over paths and assign each element to the variable path:

        [ ] call load_csv() with the path argument

        [ ] append the returned value to cards using the .extend() method
