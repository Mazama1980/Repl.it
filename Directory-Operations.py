    People files

    This exercise is to generate files for a list of people that you can use to
    keep track of notes, birthday info, gift ideas etc.

    At the end of the exercise you should have a folder containing a file for each
    person that contains something related to that person.

    [x] Make a list of people's names that you'd like to keep track of information about.
    [x] Create a new directory called something like `people` if it does not exist.
    [x] Iterate over the list of people.
        [x] Create a blank file called `{name}.txt` in the `people` directory if it doesn't exist.
        [x] Write something to the file about that person

    [x] Write something different for each person in the list
        [x] Change the list to a dict where the key is the name of the person
            and the value is a gift idea.
        [x] Change your for loop to get the name and gift of each item
            in the dict using the .items() method
        [x] Write a second line to the file with their gift idea
